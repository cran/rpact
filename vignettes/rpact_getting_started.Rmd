## User Concept

### Workflow

* Everything is starting with a design, e.g.: 
`design <- getDesignGroupSequential()`
* Find the optimal design parameters with help of `rpact` comparison tools:
`getDesignSet`
* Calculate the required sample size, e.g.: `getSampleSizeMeans()`,
`getPowerMeans()`
* Simulate specific characteristics of an adaptive design, e.g.:
`getSimulationMeans()` 
* Collect your data, import it into R and create a dataset:
  `data <- getDataset()` 
* Analyze your data: `getAnalysisResults(design, data)`

### Focus on Usability

The most important `rpact` functions have intuitive names:

* `getDesign`[`GroupSequential`/`InverseNormal`/`Fisher`]`()`
* `getDesignCharacteristics()`
* `getSampleSize`[`Means`/`Rates`/`Survival`/`Counts`]`()`
* `getPower`[`Means`/`Rates`/`Survival`/`Counts`]`()`
* `getSimulation`[`MultiArm`/`Enrichment`]``[`Means`/`Rates`/`Survival`]`()`
* `getDataSet()`
* `getAnalysisResults()`
* `getStageResults()`

RStudio/Eclipse: auto code completion makes it easy to use these functions.

### R generics

In general, everything runs with the R standard functions which are always
present in R: so-called R generics, e.g., `print`, `summary`, `plot`,
`as.data.frame`, `names`, `length`

### Utilities

Several utility functions are available, e.g.

* `getAccrualTime()`
* `getPiecewiseSurvivalTime()`
* `getNumberOfSubjects()`
* `getEventProbabilities()`
* `getPiecewiseExponentialDistribution()`
* survival helper functions for conversion of `pi`, `lambda` and `median`, e.g.,
  `getLambdaByMedian()`
* `testPackage()`: installation qualification on a client computer or company
  server (via unit tests)
