#' @title
#' rpact - Confirmatory Adaptive Clinical Trial Design and Analysis
#'
#' @description
#' rpact (R Package for Adaptive Clinical Trials) is a comprehensive package that enables
#' the design, simulation, and analysis of confirmatory adaptive group sequential designs.
#' Particularly, the methods described in the recent monograph by Wassmer and Brannath
#' (published by Springer, 2016) are implemented. It also comprises advanced methods for sample
#' size calculations for fixed sample size designs incl., e.g., sample size calculation for survival
#' trials with piecewise exponentially distributed survival times and staggered patients entry.
#'
#' @details
#' rpact includes the classical group sequential designs (incl. user spending function approaches)
#' where the sample sizes per stage (or the time points of interim analysis) cannot be changed
#' in a data-driven way.
#' Confirmatory adaptive designs explicitly allow for this under control of the Type I error rate.
#' They are either based on the combination testing or the conditional rejection
#' probability (CRP) principle.
#' Both are available, for the former the inverse normal combination test and
#' Fisher's combination test can be used.
#'
#' Specific techniques of the adaptive methodology are also available, e.g.,
#' overall confidence intervals, overall p-values, and conditional and predictive power assessments.
#' Simulations can be performed to assess the design characteristics of a (user-defined) sample size
#' recalculation strategy. Designs are available for trials with continuous, binary, and survival endpoint.
#'

#' If you are interested in professional services round about the package or need
#' a comprehensive validation documentation to fulfill regulatory requirements
