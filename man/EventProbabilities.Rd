\item{\code{accrualIntensity}}{The absolute accrual intensities. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax}.}

\item{\code{kappa}}{The shape of the Weibull distribution if \code{kappa!=1}. Is a numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{piecewiseSurvivalTime}}{The time intervals for the piecewise definition of the exponential survival time cumulative distribution function. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{lambda1}}{The assumed hazard rate in the treatment group. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax}.}

\item{\code{lambda2}}{The assumed hazard rate in the reference group. Is a numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{allocationRatioPlanned}}{The planned allocation ratio (\code{n1 / n2}) for the groups. For multi-arm designs, it is the allocation ratio relating the active arm(s) to the control. Is a positive numeric vector of length 1.}
