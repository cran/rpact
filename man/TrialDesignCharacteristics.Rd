\title{Trial Design Characteristics}
\description{
Class for trial design characteristics.
}
\details{
\code{TrialDesignCharacteristics} contains all fields required
to collect the characteristics of a design.
This object should not be created directly; use \code{getDesignCharacteristics}
with suitable arguments to create it.
}
\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{nFixed}}{The sample size in a fixed (one-stage) design. Is a positive numeric vector.}

\item{\code{shift}}{The shift value for group sequential test characteristics. Is a numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{inflationFactor}}{The relative increase of maximum sample size in a group sequential design as compared to the fixed sample size case. Is a positive numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{stages}}{The stage numbers of the trial. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax} containing whole numbers.}

\item{\code{information}}{The information over stages needed to achieve power of the specified design. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax}.}

\item{\code{power}}{The one-sided power at each stage of the trial. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax} containing values between 0 and 1.}

\item{\code{rejectionProbabilities}}{The rejection probabilities over treatments arms or populations and stages. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{futilityProbabilities}}{The overall probabilities of stopping the trial for futility. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax} minus 1 containing values between 0 and 1.}

\item{\code{averageSampleNumber1}}{The expected sample size under H1. Is a positive numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{averageSampleNumber01}}{The expected sample size for a value between H0 and H1. Is a positive numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{averageSampleNumber0}}{The expected sample size under H0. Is a positive numeric vector of length 1.}
}}
