Basic class for trial designs.
}
\details{
\code{TrialDesign} is the basic class for
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{TrialDesignFisher}},
\item \code{\link{TrialDesignGroupSequential}},
\item \code{\link{TrialDesignInverseNormal}}, and
\item \code{\link{TrialDesignConditionalDunnett}}.

\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{kMax}}{The maximum number of stages \code{K}. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a whole number.}

\item{\code{alpha}}{The significance level alpha, default is 0.025. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a value between 0 and 1.}

\item{\code{stages}}{The stage numbers of the trial. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax} containing whole numbers.}

\item{\code{informationRates}}{The information rates (that must be fixed prior to the trial), default is \code{(1:kMax) / kMax}. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax} containing values between 0 and 1.}

\item{\code{userAlphaSpending}}{The user defined alpha spending. Contains the cumulative alpha-spending (type I error rate) up to each interim stage. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax} containing values between 0 and 1.}

\item{\code{criticalValues}}{The critical values for each stage of the trial. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax}.}

\item{\code{stageLevels}}{The adjusted significance levels to reach significance in a group sequential design. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax} containing values between 0 and 1.}

\item{\code{alphaSpent}}{The cumulative alpha spent at each stage. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax} containing values between 0 and 1.}

\item{\code{bindingFutility}}{If \code{TRUE}, the calculation of the critical values is affected by the futility bounds and the futility threshold is binding in the sense that the study must be stopped if the futility condition was reached (default is \code{FALSE}) Is a logical vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{tolerance}}{The numerical tolerance, default is \code{1e-06}. Is a numeric vector of length 1.}
