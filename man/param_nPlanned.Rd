\title{Parameter Description: N Planned}
\arguments{
\item{nPlanned}{The additional (i.e., "new" and not cumulative) sample size planned for each of the subsequent stages.
The argument must be a vector with length equal to the number of remaining stages and contain
the combined sample size from both treatment groups if two groups are considered. For survival outcomes,
it should contain the planned number of additional events.
For multi-arm designs, it is the per-comparison (combined) sample size.
For enrichment designs, it is the (combined) sample size for the considered sub-population.}
