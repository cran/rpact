\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{riskRatio}}{Specifies if the sample size for one-sided testing of H0: \code{pi1 / pi2 = thetaH0} has been calculated. Is a logical vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{thetaH0}}{The difference or assumed effect under H0. Is a numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{normalApproximation}}{Describes if a normal approximation was used when calculating p-values. Default for means is \code{FALSE} and \code{TRUE} for rates and hazard ratio. Is a logical vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{pi1}}{The assumed probability or probabilities in the active treatment group in two-group designs, or the alternative probability for a one-group design.}

\item{\code{pi2}}{The assumed probability in the reference group for two-group designs. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a value between 0 and 1.}

\item{\code{groups}}{The group numbers. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{allocationRatioPlanned}}{The planned allocation ratio (\code{n1 / n2}) for the groups. For multi-arm designs, it is the allocation ratio relating the active arm(s) to the control. Is a positive numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{optimumAllocationRatio}}{The allocation ratio that is optimum with respect to the overall sample size at given power. Is a logical vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{directionUpper}}{Specifies the direction of the alternative, only applicable for one-sided testing. Default is \code{TRUE} which means that larger values of the test statistics yield smaller p-values. Is a logical vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{effect}}{The effect for randomly creating normally distributed responses. Is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax}.}

\item{\code{overallReject}}{The overall rejection probability. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{rejectPerStage}}{The probability to reject a hypothesis per stage of the trial. Is a numeric matrix.}

\item{\code{futilityPerStage}}{The per-stage probabilities of stopping the trial for futility. Is a numeric matrix.}

\item{\code{earlyStop}}{The probability to stopping the trial either for efficacy or futility. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{nFixed}}{The sample size in a fixed (one-stage) design. Is a positive numeric vector.}

\item{\code{nFixed1}}{The sample size in treatment arm 1 in a fixed (one-stage) design. Is a positive numeric vector.}

\item{\code{nFixed2}}{The sample size in treatment arm 2 in a fixed (one-stage) design. Is a positive numeric vector.}

\item{\code{numberOfSubjects}}{In simulation results data set: The number of subjects under consideration when the interim analysis takes place.}

\item{\code{numberOfSubjects1}}{In simulation results data set: The number of subjects under consideration in treatment arm 1 when the interim analysis takes place.}

\item{\code{numberOfSubjects2}}{In simulation results data set: The number of subjects under consideration in treatment arm 2 when the interim analysis takes place.}

\item{\code{expectedNumberOfSubjectsH0}}{The expected number of subjects under H0. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{expectedNumberOfSubjectsH01}}{The expected number of subjects under a value between H0 and H1. Is a numeric vector.}
