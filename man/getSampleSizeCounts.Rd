\arguments{
\item{design}{The trial design. If no trial design is specified, a fixed sample size design is used.
In this case, Type I error rate \code{alpha}, Type II error rate \code{beta}, \code{twoSidedPower},
and \code{sided} can be directly entered as argument where necessary.}

\item{...}{Ensures that all arguments (starting from the "...") are to be named and
that a warning will be displayed if unknown arguments are passed.}

\item{lambda1}{A numeric value or vector that represents the assumed rate of a homogeneous Poisson process in
the active treatment group, there is no default.}

\item{lambda2}{A numeric value that represents the assumed rate of a homogeneous Poisson process in
the control group, there is no default.}

\item{lambda}{A numeric value or vector that represents the assumed rate of a homogeneous Poisson process in
the pooled treatment groups, there is no default.}

\item{theta}{A numeric value or vector that represents the assumed mean ratios lambda1/lambda2 of a homogeneous
Poisson process, there is no default.}

\item{thetaH0}{The null hypothesis value,
default is \code{0} for the normal and the binary case (testing means and rates, respectively),
it is \code{1} for the survival case (testing the hazard ratio).\cr\cr
For non-inferiority designs, \code{thetaH0} is the non-inferiority bound.
That is, in case of (one-sided) testing of
\itemize{
\item \emph{means}: a value \code{!= 0}
(or a value \code{!= 1} for testing the mean ratio) can be specified.
\item \emph{rates}: a value \code{!= 0}
(or a value \code{!= 1} for testing the risk ratio \code{pi1 / pi2}) can be specified.
\item \emph{survival data}: a bound for testing H0: \code{hazard ratio = thetaH0 != 1} can be specified.
\item \emph{count data}: a bound for testing H0: \code{lambda1 / lambda2 = thetaH0 != 1} can be specified.
}
For testing a rate in one sample, a value \code{thetaH0} in (0, 1) has to be specified for
defining the null hypothesis H0: \code{pi = thetaH0}.}

\item{overdispersion}{A numeric value that represents the assumed overdispersion of the negative binomial distribution,
default is \code{0}.}

\item{fixedExposureTime}{If specified, the fixed time of exposure per subject for count data, there is no default.}

\item{accrualTime}{If specified, the assumed accrual time interval(s) for the study, there is no default.}

\item{accrualIntensity}{If specified, the assumed accrual intensities for the study, there is no default.}

\item{followUpTime}{If specified, The assumed (additional) follow-up time for the study, there is no default.
The total study duration is \code{accrualTime + followUpTime}.}

\item{maxNumberOfSubjects}{\code{maxNumberOfSubjects > 0} needs to be specified for power calculations or calculation
of necessary follow-up (count data). For two treatment arms, it is the maximum number of subjects for both treatment arms.}

\item{allocationRatioPlanned}{The planned allocation ratio \code{n1 / n2} for a two treatment groups
design, default is \code{1}. If \code{allocationRatioPlanned = 0} is entered,
the optimal allocation ratio yielding the smallest overall sample size is determined.}

\description{
Returns the sample size for testing the ratio of mean rates
of negative binomial distributed event numbers in two samples at given effect.
}
\details{
At given design the function calculates the information, and stage-wise and maximum sample size for testing mean rates
of negative binomial distributed event numbers in two samples at given effect.
The sample size calculation is performed either for a fixed exposure time or a variable exposure time with fixed follow-up.
For the variable exposure time case, at given maximum sample size the necessary follow-up time is calculated.
The planned calendar time of interim stages is calculated if an accrual time is defined.
Additionally, an allocation ratio = \code{n1 / n2} can be specified where \code{n1} and \code{n2} are the number
of subjects in the two treatment groups. A null hypothesis value \code{thetaH0} can also be specified.

Click on the link of a generic in the list above to go directly to the help documentation of
the \code{rpact} specific implementation of the generic.
Note that you can use the R function \code{\link[utils]{methods}} to get all the methods of a generic and
to identify the object specific name of it, e.g.,
use \code{methods("plot")} to get all the methods for the \code{plot} generic.
There you can find, e.g., \code{plot.AnalysisResults} and
obtain the specific help documentation linked above by typing \code{?plot.AnalysisResults}.
