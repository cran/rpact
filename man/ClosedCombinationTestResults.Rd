\title{Analysis Results Closed Combination Test}
\description{
Class for multi-arm analysis results based on a closed combination test.
}
\details{
This object cannot be created directly; use \code{\link{getAnalysisResults}}
with suitable arguments to create the multi-arm analysis results of a closed combination test design.
