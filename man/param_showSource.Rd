\title{Parameter Description: Show Source}
\arguments{
\item{showSource}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the parameter names of the object will
be printed which were used to create the plot; that may be, e.g.,
useful to check the values or to create own plots with the base R \code{plot} function.
Alternatively \code{showSource} can be defined as one of the following character values:
\itemize{
\item \code{"commands"}: returns a character vector with plot commands
\item \code{"axes"}: returns a list with the axes definitions
\item \code{"test"}: all plot commands will be validated with \code{eval(parse())} and
returned as character vector (function does not stop if an error occurs)
\item \code{"validate"}: all plot commands will be validated with \code{eval(parse())} and
returned as character vector (function stops if an error occurs)
}
Note: no plot object will be returned if \code{showSource} is a character.}
