\arguments{
\item{design}{The trial design. If no trial design is specified, a fixed sample size design is used.
In this case, Type I error rate \code{alpha}, Type II error rate \code{beta}, \code{twoSidedPower},
and \code{sided} can be directly entered as argument where necessary.}

\item{...}{Ensures that all arguments (starting from the "...") are to be named and
that a warning will be displayed if unknown arguments are passed.}

\item{thetaH0}{The null hypothesis value,
default is \code{0} for the normal and the binary case (testing means and rates, respectively),
it is \code{1} for the survival case (testing the hazard ratio).\cr\cr
For non-inferiority designs, \code{thetaH0} is the non-inferiority bound.
That is, in case of (one-sided) testing of
\itemize{
\item \emph{means}: a value \code{!= 0}
(or a value \code{!= 1} for testing the mean ratio) can be specified.
\item \emph{rates}: a value \code{!= 0}
(or a value \code{!= 1} for testing the risk ratio \code{pi1 / pi2}) can be specified.
\item \emph{survival data}: a bound for testing H0: \code{hazard ratio = thetaH0 != 1} can be specified.
\item \emph{count data}: a bound for testing H0: \code{lambda1 / lambda2 = thetaH0 != 1} can be specified.
}
For testing a rate in one sample, a value \code{thetaH0} in (0, 1) has to be specified for
defining the null hypothesis H0: \code{pi = thetaH0}.}

\item{directionUpper}{Logical. Specifies the direction of the alternative,
only applicable for one-sided testing; default is \code{TRUE}
which means that larger values of the test statistics yield smaller p-values.}

\item{pi1}{A numeric value or vector that represents the assumed event rate in the treatment group,
default is \code{seq(0.2, 0.5, 0.1)} (power calculations and simulations) or
\code{seq(0.4, 0.6, 0.1)} (sample size calculations).}

\item{pi2}{A numeric value that represents the assumed event rate in the control group, default is \code{0.2}.}

\item{lambda1}{The assumed hazard rate in the treatment group, there is no default.
\code{lambda1} can also be used to define piecewise exponentially distributed survival times (see details). Must be a positive numeric of length 1.}

\item{lambda2}{The assumed hazard rate in the reference group, there is no default.
\code{lambda2} can also be used to define piecewise exponentially distributed survival times (see details). Must be a positive numeric of length 1.}

\item{median1}{The assumed median survival time in the treatment group, there is no default.}

\item{median2}{The assumed median survival time in the reference group, there is no default. Must be a positive numeric of length 1.}

\item{hazardRatio}{The vector of hazard ratios under consideration.
If the event or hazard rates in both treatment groups are defined, the hazard ratio needs
not to be specified as it is calculated, there is no default. Must be a positive numeric of length 1.}

\item{kappa}{A numeric value > 0. A \code{kappa != 1} will be used for the specification
of the shape of the Weibull distribution.
Default is \code{1}, i.e., the exponential survival distribution is used instead of the Weibull distribution.
Note that the Weibull distribution cannot be used for the piecewise definition of
the survival time distribution, i.e., only \code{piecewiselambda} (as a single value) and \code{kappa}
can be specified.
This function is equivalent to \code{pweibull(t, shape = kappa, scale = 1 / lambda)}
of the \code{stats} package, i.e., the scale parameter is \code{1 / 'hazard rate'}.\cr
For example,
\code{getPiecewiseExponentialDistribution(time = 130, piecewiseLambda = 0.01, kappa = 4.2)}
and \code{pweibull(q = 130, shape = 4.2, scale = 1 / 0.01)} provide the sample result.}

\item{piecewiseSurvivalTime}{A vector that specifies the time intervals for the piecewise
definition of the exponential survival time cumulative distribution function \cr
(for details see \code{\link[=getPiecewiseSurvivalTime]{getPiecewiseSurvivalTime()}}).}

\item{allocation1}{The number how many subjects are assigned to treatment 1 in a
subsequent order, default is \code{1}}

\item{allocation2}{The number how many subjects are assigned to treatment 2 in a

\item{accrualIntensity}{A numeric vector of accrual intensities, default is the relative
intensity \code{0.1} (for details see \code{\link[=getAccrualTime]{getAccrualTime()}}).}

\item{accrualIntensityType}{A character value specifying the accrual intensity input type.
Must be one of \code{"auto"}, \code{"absolute"}, or \code{"relative"}; default is \code{"auto"},
i.e., if all values are < 1 the type is \code{"relative"}, otherwise it is \code{"absolute"}.}

\item{dropoutRate1}{The assumed drop-out rate in the treatment group, default is \code{0}.}

\item{dropoutRate2}{The assumed drop-out rate in the control group, default is \code{0}.}

\item{dropoutTime}{The assumed time for drop-out rates in the control and the
treatment group, default is \code{12}.}

\item{maxNumberOfSubjects}{\code{maxNumberOfSubjects > 0} needs to be specified.
If accrual time and accrual intensity are specified, this will be calculated. Must be a positive integer of length 1.}

\item{plannedEvents}{\code{plannedEvents} is a numeric vector of length \code{kMax} (the number of stages of the design)
that determines the number of cumulated (overall) events in survival designs when the interim stages are planned.
For two treatment arms, it is the number of events for both treatment arms.
For multi-arm designs, \code{plannedEvents} refers to the overall number of events for the selected arms plus control.}

\item{minNumberOfEventsPerStage}{When performing a data driven sample size recalculation,
the numeric vector \code{minNumberOfEventsPerStage} with length kMax determines the
minimum number of events per stage (i.e., not cumulated), the first element
is not taken into account.}

\item{maxNumberOfEventsPerStage}{When performing a data driven sample size recalculation,
the numeric vector \code{maxNumberOfEventsPerStage} with length kMax determines the maximum number
of events per stage (i.e., not cumulated), the first element is not taken into account.}

\item{conditionalPower}{If \code{conditionalPower} together with \code{minNumberOfSubjectsPerStage} and
\code{maxNumberOfSubjectsPerStage} (or \code{minNumberOfEventsPerStage} and \code{maxNumberOfEventsPerStage}
for survival designs) is specified, a sample size recalculation based on the specified conditional power is performed.
It is defined as the power for the subsequent stage given the current data. By default,
the conditional power will be calculated under the observed effect size. Optionally, you can also specify \code{thetaH1} and
\code{stDevH1} (for simulating means), \code{pi1H1} and \code{pi2H1} (for simulating rates), or \code{thetaH1} (for simulating
hazard ratios) as parameters under which it is calculated and the sample size recalculation is performed.}

\item{thetaH1}{If specified, the value of the alternative under which
the conditional power or sample size recalculation calculation is performed. Must be a numeric of length 1.}

\item{seed}{The seed to reproduce the simulation, default is a random seed.}

\item{calcEventsFunction}{Optionally, a function can be entered that defines the way of performing the sample size
recalculation. By default, event number recalculation is performed with conditional power and specified
\code{minNumberOfEventsPerStage} and \code{maxNumberOfEventsPerStage} (see details and examples).}

\item{showStatistics}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, summary statistics of the simulated data
are displayed for the \code{print} command, otherwise the output is suppressed, default
is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{\link{SimulationResults}} object.
The following generics (R generic functions) are available for this object:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=names.FieldSet]{names()}} to obtain the field names,
\item \code{\link[=print.FieldSet]{print()}} to print the object,
\item \code{\link[=summary.ParameterSet]{summary()}} to display a summary of the object,
\item \code{\link[=plot.SimulationResults]{plot()}} to plot the object,
\item \code{\link[=as.data.frame.ParameterSet]{as.data.frame()}} to coerce the object to a \code{\link[base]{data.frame}},
\item \code{\link[=as.matrix.FieldSet]{as.matrix()}} to coerce the object to a \code{\link[base]{matrix}}.
}
}
\description{
Returns the analysis times, power, stopping probabilities, conditional power, and expected sample size
for testing the hazard ratio in a two treatment groups survival design.
}
\details{
At given design the function simulates the power, stopping probabilities, conditional power, and expected
sample size at given number of events, number of subjects, and parameter configuration.
It also simulates the time when the required events are expected under the given
assumptions (exponentially, piecewise exponentially, or Weibull distributed survival times
and constant or non-constant piecewise accrual).
Additionally, integers \code{allocation1} and \code{allocation2} can be specified that determine the number allocated
to treatment group 1 and treatment group 2, respectively.
More precisely, unequal randomization ratios must be specified via the two integer arguments \code{allocation1} and
\code{allocation2} which describe how many subjects are consecutively enrolled in each group, respectively, before a
subject is assigned to the other group. For example, the arguments \code{allocation1 = 2}, \code{allocation2 = 1},
\code{maxNumberOfSubjects = 300} specify 2:1 randomization with 200 subjects randomized to intervention and 100 to
control. (Caveat: Do not use \code{allocation1 = 200}, \code{allocation2 = 100}, \code{maxNumberOfSubjects = 300}
as this would imply that the 200 intervention subjects are enrolled prior to enrollment of any control subjects.)

\code{conditionalPower}\cr
The definition of \code{thetaH1} makes only sense if \code{kMax} > 1
and if \code{conditionalPower}, \code{minNumberOfEventsPerStage}, and
\code{maxNumberOfEventsPerStage} are defined.

Note that \code{numberOfSubjects}, \code{numberOfSubjects1}, and \code{numberOfSubjects2} in the output
are the expected number of subjects.

\code{calcEventsFunction}\cr
This function returns the number of events at given conditional power and conditional critical value for specified
testing situation. The function might depend on variables
\code{stage},
\code{conditionalPower},
\code{thetaH0},
\code{plannedEvents},
\code{singleEventsPerStage},
\code{minNumberOfEventsPerStage},
\code{maxNumberOfEventsPerStage},
\code{allocationRatioPlanned},
\code{conditionalCriticalValue},
The function has to contain the three-dots argument '...' (see examples).
}
\section{Piecewise survival time}{

The first element of the vector \code{piecewiseSurvivalTime} must be equal to \code{0}.
\code{piecewiseSurvivalTime} can also be a list that combines the definition of the
time intervals and hazard rates in the reference group.
The definition of the survival time in the treatment group is obtained by the specification
of the hazard ratio (see examples for details).
}

\section{Staggered patient entry}{

\code{accrualTime} is the time period of subjects' accrual in a study.
It can be a value that defines the end of accrual or a vector.
In this case, \code{accrualTime} can be used to define a non-constant accrual over time.
For this, \code{accrualTime} is a vector that defines the accrual intervals.
The first element of \code{accrualTime} must be equal to \code{0} and, additionally,
\code{accrualIntensity} needs to be specified.
\code{accrualIntensity} itself is a value or a vector (depending on the
length of \code{accrualTime}) that defines the intensity how subjects
enter the trial in the intervals defined through \code{accrualTime}.

\code{accrualTime} can also be a list that combines the definition of the accrual time and
accrual intensity (see below and examples for details).

If the length of \code{accrualTime} and the length of \code{accrualIntensity} are the same
(i.e., the end of accrual is undefined), \code{maxNumberOfSubjects > 0} needs to be specified
and the end of accrual is calculated.
In that case, \code{accrualIntensity} is the number of subjects per time unit, i.e., the absolute accrual intensity.

If the length of \code{accrualTime} equals the length of \code{accrualIntensity - 1}
(i.e., the end of accrual is defined), \code{maxNumberOfSubjects} is calculated if the absolute accrual intensity is given.
If all elements in \code{accrualIntensity} are smaller than 1, \code{accrualIntensity} defines
the \emph{relative} intensity how subjects enter the trial.
For example, \code{accrualIntensity = c(0.1, 0.2)} specifies that in the second accrual interval
the intensity is doubled as compared to the first accrual interval. The actual (absolute) accrual intensity
is calculated for the calculated or given \code{maxNumberOfSubjects}.
Note that the default is \code{accrualIntensity = 0.1} meaning that the \emph{absolute} accrual intensity
will be calculated.
}

\section{Simulation Data}{

The summary statistics "Simulated data" contains the following parameters: median \link{range}; mean +/-sd\cr

\code{$show(showStatistics = FALSE)} or \code{$setShowStatistics(FALSE)} can be used to disable
the output of the aggregated simulated data.\cr

Example 1: \cr
\code{simulationResults <- getSimulationSurvival(maxNumberOfSubjects = 100, plannedEvents = 30)} \cr
\code{simulationResults$show(showStatistics = FALSE)}\cr

Example 2: \cr
\code{simulationResults <- getSimulationSurvival(maxNumberOfSubjects = 100, plannedEvents = 30)} \cr
\code{simulationResults$setShowStatistics(FALSE)}\cr

\item \code{eventsPerStage2}: The observed number of events per stage
in treatment group 2.
\item \code{singleEventsPerStage}: The observed number of events per stage
in both treatment groups.
\item \code{rejectPerStage}: 1 if null hypothesis can be rejected, 0 otherwise.
\item \code{futilityPerStage}: 1 if study should be stopped for futility, 0 otherwise.
\item \code{eventsNotAchieved}: 1 if number of events could not be reached with
observed number of subjects, 0 otherwise.
\item \code{testStatistic}: The test statistic that is used for the test decision,
depends on which design was chosen (group sequential, inverse normal,
or Fisher combination test)'
\item \code{logRankStatistic}: Z-score statistic which corresponds to a one-sided
log-rank test at considered stage.
\item \code{hazardRatioEstimateLR}: The estimated hazard ratio, derived from the
log-rank statistic.
\item \code{trialStop}: \code{TRUE} if study should be stopped for efficacy or futility or final stage, \code{FALSE} otherwise.
\item \code{conditionalPowerAchieved}: The conditional power for the subsequent stage of the trial for
selected sample size and effect. The effect is either estimated from the data or can be
user defined with \code{thetaH1}.
