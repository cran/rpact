\title{Parameter Description: Allocation Ratio Planned}
\arguments{
\item{allocationRatioPlanned}{The planned allocation ratio \code{n1 / n2} for a two treatment groups
design, default is \code{1}. For multi-arm designs, it is the allocation ratio relating the active arm(s) to the control.
For simulating means and rates for a two treatment groups design, it can be a vector of length \code{kMax}, the number of stages.
It can be a vector of length kMax, too, for multi-arm and enrichment designs.
In these cases, a change of allocating subjects to treatment groups over the stages can be assessed.
Note that internally \code{allocationRatioPlanned} is treated as a vector of length \code{kMax}, not a scalar.}
