\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{thetaH0}}{The difference or assumed effect under H0. Is a numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{groups}}{The group numbers. Is a numeric vector.}

\item{\code{allocationRatioPlanned}}{The planned allocation ratio (\code{n1 / n2}) for the groups. For multi-arm designs, it is the allocation ratio relating the active arm(s) to the control. Is a positive numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{\code{optimumAllocationRatio}}{The allocation ratio that is optimum with respect to the overall sample size at given power. Is a logical vector of length 1.}
